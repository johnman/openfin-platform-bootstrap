    <h1>
      This is an example of a platform app that bootstraps the UI and doesn't
      have the initial view/window in a manifest
    </h1>
    <p>
      It also has an additional example that raises the question about auth
      where a url request may be intercepted and redirected to a login page. The
      example here uses a preload script to show the provider window if it
      believes the window has been redirected to a login page and to hide it
      once more once login is complete. An alternative approach may be to set
      autoShow to true in the config and have your bootstrap set it to hidden
      when it runs. This may however result in a brief flash of UI as the window
      loads and then is hidden.
